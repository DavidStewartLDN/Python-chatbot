### Python Chatbot

This is a project made using historical reddit comments from January 2015. This code will intially follow the [Sentdex youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOnYLDg8_Y). This chatbot uses Pyton and Tensorflow for deep learning

#### Purpose

I have been interested in making a chatbot for language learning that could make simple conversation and increase the difficulty of the language used as the user learns.

By following this youtube series I can learn about how to take raw data, convert it into a useable form for a machine learning algorithm and then pass this into a machine learning algorithm. The direction I am interested in working towards is the ability to respond to an user input in both the mother tongue of the user and the desired language of learning. Further to this, if the user could input using speech and voice recognition (maybe using React front-end and APIs) could then convert to target learning language.

#### Learning goals
I can: 
- [ ] take in raw data and convert it into a useable format
- [ ] create an algorithm to analyse speech structure using thread and comment structure
- [ ] connect model to talking task
- [ ] create a front end in which to control the model
- [ ] understand how to control complexity of language outputed
- [ ] understand how to recommend answers to return in two languages
- [ ] understand how to integrate React native speech recogition into front end

#### Tech used
- Python and TensorFlow

#### How to Run

- To be updated
